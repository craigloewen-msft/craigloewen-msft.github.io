Hi there! I’m Kent.

I’m a marketing producer working on merchandising for the Store on Xbox. After participating in Hacakathon before but focusing on marketing projects, I was excited this year to go further outside my day to day and jump in to something more conventionally “hacky” – Kinect + machine learning + fitness was just the right combination.

My main contributions to the project were the script and production of the video and contributing a handful of reasonable ideas to the UX flows.

Being focused on storytelling and less conversant than the rest of the team in the technical nuts and bolts, I had the opportunity to be blown away by the dark, impenetrable arts that are competent design and molding 1s and 0s into a functioning app. I’m grateful to the team for letting me sit at the cool table and proud to have been a part of an awesome project.
