Hi my name's Craig!

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm also a program management intern working at Microsoft for the summer of 2017, on the Windows Console and Windows Subsystem for Linux team.

I'm really passionate about fitness, and so I was excited to start Spot Me! I built a prototype for the app in 2016, and it's AMAZING to see the what our team could do to make the app usable and fun!

My main contributions to the app were **leading development for the code base**, and **project management**. 

As a PM it was amazing to work with this team, as we were quite cross disciplinary with Melissa being a designer, Kent being a story teller, and Jhony being a developer. I was able to wrangle our different interests and skills to create the app you see before you on this website!

As a developer lead Spot Me posed a significant technological challenge. It took a lot of research and finetuning to make the machine learning algorithm accurately predict your form, and lots of code hours to make the UI behave like the proposed design.
